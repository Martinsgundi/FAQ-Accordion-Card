## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Js
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about CSS positioning, especially regarding the placement of background images and images to seamlessly integrate them into the website's flow and avoid displacement. I also frequently used ::before and ::after pseudo-classes, which added to my knowledge.

### Continued development

I want to work on more projects that involve CSS positioning and images to strengthen and refine my knowledge of these concepts, and to become more comfortable using them in my future projects.
